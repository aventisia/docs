#### **Agents**
The Agents section enables users to create, view, and manage agents that encapsulate specific workflows or automation logic.
- An Agent acts as a modular container for AI-powered tasks or processes.
- You can maintain multiple versions of an agent (e.g., v1, v2) to track changes and support rollback when needed.
- Once an agent is published and moved to production, it transitions to the Orchestrator > Agents section for monitoring and execution management.

#### **AI Models**
The AI Models section allows users to build, fine-tune, and manage models for classification, extraction, summarization, and more—across documents, audio, and image formats.
- Users can create models by selecting the task type, base LLM, and uploading sample data for labeling and training.
- Models can be iteratively refined using human feedback to improve accuracy and performance over time.
- Once finalized, AI models can be attached to Agents for execution within production workflows.
- You can track different model versions and experiment with various LLMs to identify the most effective configuration.
