# Agents 

The Agents section enables users to create, view, and manage agents that encapsulate specific workflows or automation logic.
- An Agent acts as a modular container for AI-powered tasks or processes.
- You can maintain multiple versions of an agent (e.g., v1, v2) to track changes and support rollback when needed.
- Once an agent is published and moved to production, it transitions to the Orchestrator > Agents section for monitoring and execution management.
