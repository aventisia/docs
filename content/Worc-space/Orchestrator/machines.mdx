## Machines

Machines are Orchestrator entities that allow administrators to configure settings for unattended automation infrastructure.

![Agent Builder](../../assets/create-agent/machine.png)

In this context:

- A **machine** refers to the machine object defined in Orchestrator.
- A **host machine** represents the physical or virtual workstation where the UiPath® Robot is installed.

### Main Functions of a Machine Object

- **Authorize Robot-Orchestrator Connections**  
  Ensures secure communication between the UiPath Robot and Orchestrator. This is done using either:

  - A **machine key**, or
  - A **client ID–client secret pair**,  
    depending on the robot authentication method configured on the tenant.  
    _[Learn more about robot authentication.]_

- **Manage Execution Capacity**  
  Controls how many processes can run concurrently on the host machine.

- **Specialize Host Machines**  
  Designates specific host machines to run certain types of automation processes.

> **Note:** Machine objects are **global resources**, which means they are accessible across all folders in Orchestrator.

# Agents Dashboard
