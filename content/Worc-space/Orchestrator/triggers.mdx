# Triggers

Triggers allow you to execute jobs automatically based on predefined rules. From the **Triggers** page in Orchestrator, you can:
- Create new triggers
- Manage existing triggers
- Manually start jobs based on existing processes

---

## Trigger Types

### Based on Scope:
- **Time Triggers**: Start automations at scheduled intervals.  
  *[Learn more](#)*

- **Queue Triggers**: Start automations when new items are added to queues.  
  *[Learn more](#)*

### Based on Where They Are Created:
- **Outside the Workflow**:
  - Created by folder admins in Orchestrator
  - Includes both time and queue triggers

- **Inside the Workflow**:
  - Created at design-time by RPA developers using trigger activities
  - Only **one trigger activity** is allowed per workflow

> Triggers added in Studio are the only ones validated by Orchestrator as **package requirements**.  
> These must be included during **process creation**, from the **Package Requirements** page.

## Non-Working Days

Non-working days allow you to prevent triggers from executing on specific dates (e.g., public holidays, weekends).

- Multiple **non-working day calendars** can be created per tenant
- Each calendar can have its own list of dates
- A **BankHoliday** calendar is available by default
- Once non-business days pass, triggers resume as usual

To apply restrictions:
1. Go to the **Non-Working Days** tab under **Settings**
2. Select a calendar in the **Non-working day restrictions** drop-down when creating/editing a trigger

> Only **one calendar** can be selected per trigger  
> Editing a calendar affects all associated triggers  
> Adding/removing non-working days is **audited** at the tenant level

## Job Count Strategies

The `Triggers.JobsCountStrategy` parameter controls how many jobs a trigger will launch. You can choose from:

### 1. `PerProcess`
- Takes into account pending jobs for the same process
- Example:  
  - Trigger A: configured to launch 3 jobs  
  - Trigger B: configured to launch 5 jobs  
  - If A launches 3 jobs first, B will only launch **2** more jobs (total 5)

### 2. `PerTrigger`
- Each trigger is independent and tracks its own job count
- Example:  
  - A trigger set to launch 9 jobs  
  - If 2 jobs have already completed, next run will launch **2** more (to make up the difference)

### 3. `NoLimit`
- Ignores all existing/pending jobs
- Always launches the full number of jobs as configured  
- Example:  
  - Trigger is set to launch 5 jobs  
  - Every time it runs, it launches **5 new jobs**
