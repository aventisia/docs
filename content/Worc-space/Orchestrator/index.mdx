# Overview

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the command center of Worc-space â€” it allows you to manage, schedule, and monitor all live automations and AI agents in production. From assigning tasks to machines, managing queues and triggers, to tracking executions and accessing secure resources like keys and secrets, Orchestrator ensures your operations run smoothly, reliably, and at scale. 
It provides complete visibility and control over how your agents perform across the organization.

Orchestrator is a web application that enables you to orchestrate agents in executing repetitive business processes. Orchestrator manages the resources to be used in automation projects and consumed by agents, and access to them through support for hierarchical structuring combined with fine-grained role assignment. It acts as an integration point with third-party solutions and applications.

Its power comes from its capability of managing your entire agent fleet.

In attended automation, Orchestrator ensures the centralized management and correct delivery of package versions to agents for execution.

In unattended automation, Orchestrator allows launching unattended execution on the spot or by setting it up in a preplanned manner with triggers. Orchestrator can distribute the workload to unattended agents and, when allowed to distribute the workload dynamically (with no constraints), can maximize efficiency and optimize agent usage.
