# Overview

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the command center of Worc-space â€” it allows you to manage, schedule, and monitor all live automations and AI agents in production. From assigning tasks to machines, managing queues and triggers, to tracking executions and accessing secure resources like keys and secrets, Orchestrator ensures your operations run smoothly, reliably, and at scale.
It provides complete visibility and control over how your agents perform across the organization.

Orchestrator is a web application that enables you to orchestrate agents in executing repetitive business processes. Orchestrator manages the resources to be used in automation projects and consumed by agents, and access to them through support for hierarchical structuring combined with fine-grained role assignment. It acts as an integration point with third-party solutions and applications.

Its power comes from its capability of managing your entire agent fleet.

In attended automation, Orchestrator ensures the centralized management and correct delivery of package versions to agents for execution.

In unattended automation, Orchestrator allows launching unattended execution on the spot or by setting it up in a preplanned manner with triggers. Orchestrator can distribute the workload to unattended agents and, when allowed to distribute the workload dynamically (with no constraints), can maximize efficiency and optimize agent usage. - Machines - Queues - Triggers - Executions - Key Store - Vault

These tools help orchestrate automation processes across multiple machines and workflows:

#### **Machines**

- Represents the computing resources (on-premise or cloud-based) that execute agents and workflows.
- Users can register machines, assign workloads, and monitor their availability and status.

#### **Queues**

- Manages task scheduling and distribution across agents and machines.
- Helps balance workloads and enables prioritization, retry logic, and scalability for high-throughput environments.

#### **Triggers**

- Automates execution of workflows using event-based or time-based triggers.
- Examples: Trigger a process daily at 8 AM, or when a file is uploaded or an email is received.

#### **Executions**

- Logs and monitors every instance of a workflow or agent execution.
- Provides detailed insights including:
- Current and historical execution status (e.g., Running, Success, Failed)
- Logs, error messages, and audit trails
- Execution time and performance metrics

#### **Key Store**

- A secure repository to store API keys, credentials, and environment variables.
- Ensures secrets are accessible only during workflow execution, avoiding hardcoding or manual input.

#### **Vault**

- A robust security layer for storing and managing highly sensitive or encrypted information.
- Supports access controls, version history, and compliance-grade auditing to meet enterprise security standards.
