# Execution

> **Note**: To fully understand Executions, it's important to first grasp the concept of **processes**, including runtime arguments, process types, and compatibility.

A **Execution** represents the execution instance of a process on a Display agent. Executions can run in **attended** or **unattended** mode.

---

## Execution Modes

- **Attended Executions**:

  - Triggered from **Display Assistant** or **agent Command Line Interface (CLI)**
  - Cannot be started from Orchestrator, except for **debugging** or **development** purposes

- **Unattended Executions**:
  - Triggered directly from **Orchestrator** (Executions or Processes page)
  - Can also be scheduled via **Triggers**

---

## Executions Page Overview

The **Executions page** in Orchestrator serves as the control center for managing Execution execution. You can:

- Monitor Execution status
- View execution logs
- Stop, kill, resume, or restart Executions
