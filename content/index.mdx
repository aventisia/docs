# Begin your journey with Worc!

Welcome to Aventisia! We've designed this course as your first step in mastering Worc, which is built specifically for modern digital transformation teams like yours.

## What is Worc?

Worc is a powerful workflow automation platform built for modern digital transformation teams. At its core is a highly flexible and configurable workflow engine that makes it easy to design, build, and adapt workflows tailored exactly to your business needs.

Whether you’re a B2B services company helping clients digitize and automate their operations, or an enterprise transforming your own internal processes, Worc by Aventisia gives you the tools to do it right.

When we set out to build Worc, we started with a blank canvas and first-principles thinking. That same open, modular approach is what we’ve embedded into the platform — empowering teams to design new workflows, automate existing processes, and build smarter digital solutions from the ground up.

By the end of this journey, we believe you’ll see why Worc simply works.
