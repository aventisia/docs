# Delete Duplicate Rows From Data Table

The **Delete Duplicate Rows From Data Table** node allows you to efficiently identify and remove any duplicate rows within a data table. It is particularly useful in scenarios where data consistency and uniqueness are crucial, such as preparing datasets for analysis or reporting.

For example:

- Cleaning up survey data to ensure each respondent is counted once.
- Preparing a customer list by removing duplicate entries.
- Simplifying product databases by ensuring unique items.

## Expected Output Format

- If "All Columns" is selected, the data table is compared across all columns.
- If "Selected Columns" is chosen, only the specified columns are compared for duplicates.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Add the **Delete Duplicate Rows From Data Table** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Data Table** field, input the data table you want to process.

### Step 3

Select the **Compare Mode** from the dropdown to determine duplication comparison criteria:

- **All Columns**: Compares all columns in every row.
- **Selected Columns**: Compares only specific columns noted by you.

### Step 4

If you opt for **Selected Columns**, an additional **Column Names To Compare** field appears. Enter the column names you wish to use to identify duplicates, separated by commas.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                            | Solution                                                                                                        |

| **"Column Names To Compare" field is not visible** | Ensure you have selected **"Selected Columns"** in Compare Mode; this makes the field visible.                  |
| **Data Table input is empty or incorrect format**  | Verify and ensure that the input provided is a valid data table format.                                         |
| **Duplicates not being removed as expected**       | Double-check your Compare Mode and refresh the table data; ensure selected columns for comparison are relevant. |

## Real-World Use Cases
