### Use Case

Reversing a list is useful when:
- You want to process items from last to first.
- Sorting operations need to be undone.
- You are manipulating sequences (like logs, queues, or batches) where order matters.

This interface provides a clean, minimal setup, ensuring users can quickly apply the reverse operation with minimal configuration.
