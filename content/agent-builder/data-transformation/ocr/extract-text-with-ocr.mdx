# Extract Text With OCR 

## Description
When this function is invoked, it takes an input image or document and analyzes the visual 
content to detect and recognize any embedded characters. The OCR engine then converts this visual information into machine-encoded text. This extracted text can be further used for data validation, storage, analytics, or integration with other systems.
