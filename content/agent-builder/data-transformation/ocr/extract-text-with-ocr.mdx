# Extract Text with OCR

The **Extract Text with OCR** node enables you to convert text within an image file into editable text format by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This is especially useful if you want to digitize printed documents, convert photos with text into data you can edit, or automate text extraction from images for use in other workflows.
