# Extract Substring from Text

The **Extract Substring from Text** node is a tool that helps you extract a specific portion of a text. This is particularly useful for manipulating strings when you need to focus on or isolate parts of text for data processing, cleaning, or transformation tasks.

For instance, you might want to:

- Capture a specific section of a text, such as a product code from a longer description.
- Trim details to include only relevant information in a report or export.
- Automatically extract information like names or dates from a standard text format.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name               | Description                                                                                                               | Input Type | Required? | Default Value  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- |
| **Original Text**        | The full text value from which to extract a substring.                                                                    | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_      |
| **Start Index Type**     | Choose whether to start from the beginning of the text or a specific character position.                                  | Select     | Yes       | StartOfText    |
| **Start Index**          | The zero-based starting position for extraction. This is applicable only when `Start Index Type` is "Character Position". | Text       | No        | _(empty)_      |
| **Length Type**          | Select if you want a specific number of characters or to continue until the end of the string.                            | Select     | No        | SpecificLength |
| **Number of Characters** | How many characters you wish to extract. Appears only if `Length Type` is "Specific Length".                              | Text       | No        | _(empty)_      |

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is a **text string**, representing the portion of the original text that you specified for extraction.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Extract Substring from Text** node into your flow.

### Step 2

Enter the text you want to extract a portion from in the **Original Text** field.

### Step 3

In the **Start Index Type** dropdown, select your starting point for extraction:

- **Start of Text**: Begin from the very start of your text.
- **Character Position**: Begin from a specific position in your text.

### Step 4

If you chose **Character Position**, enter the starting position in the **Start Index** field. Remember, this uses a zero-based index (e.g., "0" starts at the first character).

### Step 5

Choose the **Length Type**:

- **Until End**: Continue extraction until the end of the text.
- **Specific Length**: Specify the number of characters you want to extract.

### Step 6

If you selected **Specific Length**, input the number of characters in the **Number of Characters** field.

### Step 7

The extracted portion will be available as **Substring Result** for use in other nodes.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  The fields **Start Index** and **Number of Characters** appear based on
  previous selections, such as "Character Position" or "Specific Length". Ensure
  your inputs make sense contextually.

## Input/Output Examples

| Start Index Type   | Start Index | Length Type     | Number of Characters | Original Text   | Output Value    |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Start of Text      | _(n/a)_     | Until End       | _(n/a)_              | "Hello, World!" | "Hello, World!" |
| Start of Text      | _(n/a)_     | Specific Length | 5                    | "Hello, World!" | "Hello"         |
| Character Position | 7           | Until End       | _(n/a)_              | "Hello, World!" | "World!"        |
| Character Position | 7           | Specific Length | 5                    | "Hello, World!" | "World"         |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                               | Solution                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start Index or Number of Characters not appearing** | Make sure you have chosen options in **Start Index Type** and **Length Type** that require these fields (e.g., "Character Position" or "Specific Length"). |
| **Non-existent character position issue**             | Verify that your **Start Index** value is not greater than the text length.                                                                                |
| **Incorrect output**                                  | Check your starting position and length settings to ensure they match desired extraction.                                                                  |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Data Parsing**: Isolate a transaction ID from a full log entry.
- **Text Cleaning**: Extract and display only the first few characters of a lengthy input.
- **Document Automation**: Select portions of standardized forms or text to insert elsewhere in a workflow.
