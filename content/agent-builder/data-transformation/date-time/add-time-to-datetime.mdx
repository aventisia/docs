# Add Time to DateTime

The **Add Time to DateTime** node lets you modify a DateTime by adding a specific amount of time. With this node, you can calculate future or past dates by adding or subtracting time in various units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years.

This is useful when you need to:

- Schedule tasks or events at a future date and time.
- Calculate deadlines or expiry dates.
- Determine age or duration changes over time.

## Input/Output Examples

| Base DateTime       | Value to Add | Time Unit | Output Value        |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| 2023-10-01T12:00:00 | 5            | Days      | 2023-10-06T12:00:00 |
| 2023-10-01T09:30:00 | 90           | Minutes   | 2023-10-01T11:00:00 |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                      | Solution                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Invalid DateTime format in Base DateTime** | Ensure your date and time input matches the required format (e.g., `2023-10-01T12:00:00`).       |
| **Non-numeric value in Value to Add**        | The value must be numeric. Avoid entering letters or symbols.                                    |
| **Incorrect time unit chosen**               | Double-check your unit of measure; adding days instead of months, for example, changes outcomes. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Event Scheduling**: Automatically calculate and adjust event dates by adding days, weeks, or months.
- **Deadline Management**: Track and update deadlines by adding or subtracting time values.
- **Logistics and Planning**: Adjust shipment and delivery dates based on transit time.
