# Merge Lists

The **Merge Lists** node lets you create a new list by combining two separate lists of items into one. This is particularly useful when you need to consolidate data from different sources into a single list for easier management and analysis.

For example:

- Merging customer names from two separate datasets into one comprehensive list.
- Combining product lists from different suppliers.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name      | Description                        | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **First List**  | The first list of items to merge.  | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Second List** | The second list of items to merge. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is a **single list value** that contains all items from both input lists, preserving the order as they were input.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| **Lists not merging**     | Check that you entered both lists in the text fields. Ensure each list is non-empty. |
| **Incorrect list format** | Double-check that items are separated correctly by commas or new lines.              |
