# Loop Node

The **Loop node** is used when you want to repeatedly execute a set of actions based on a condition or for each item in a list. It is especially useful for automating tasks that require iteration, such as processing records, retrying operations, or polling for status updates.

Think of the Loop node as your automation’s repeat engine — running the same steps again and again until your specified condition is no longer met or until all items are processed.

## Repeat Method

You can choose how the loop should repeat using the **Repeat Method** dropdown:

- **Repeat based on condition**: The loop continues executing as long as the specified condition(s) are true.
- **Repeat for every item in a list**: Executes the loop once for each item in the provided list.

## Configuring Loop Conditions

Conditions determine whether the loop will continue to run.

You can create one or more **condition groups**, combining conditions with **AND** and **OR** logic:

- Use **+ AND** to add multiple conditions within a group that must *all* be true.
- Use **+ OR** to create a new group of conditions. The loop will continue if *any one group* is true.

## Supported Operators

### Basic Comparisons
- **Is Equal To / Exactly Matches**: Match static or dynamic values (e.g., `status Is Equal To "Active"`).
- **Is Greater Than / Is Less Than**: Check numerical or date values (e.g., `Balance Is Greater Than 5000`).

### Boolean Checks
- **Is True / Is False**: Use when evaluating flags or toggles (e.g., `isVerified Is True`).

### Text Logic
- **Contains (Text)**: `Comment Contains "error"`
- **Does Not Contain (Text)**: `Name Does Not Contain "test"`
- **Starts With / Ends With**: `Filename Starts With "invoice_"`, `Email Ends With "@domain.com"`
- **Does Not Start With / Does Not End With**: Negation of prefix/suffix checks.
- **Does Not Exactly Match**: `Status Does Not Exactly Match "Complete"`

### Existence Checks
- **Exists / Does Not Exist**: Useful when values are optional (e.g., `ErrorCode Exists`)
- **Is Empty / Is Not Empty**: For strings, arrays, or lists (e.g., `PhoneNumber Is Not Empty`)

### List Logic
- **Contains (List)**: `AssignedRoles Contains (List) "Manager"`
- **Does Not Contain (List)**: `Tags Does Not Contain (List) "Urgent"`

### Date & Time
- **After / Before**: `DueDate Before "2025-12-01"`
- **Equals (DateTime)**: `ScheduledTime Equals "2025-07-09T10:00:00Z"`

---

## Example Configuration

### Repeat based on condition

**Group 1 (AND):**
- `Status Is Equal To "Active"`
- `Retries Is Less Than 3`

**Group 2 (OR):**
- `LastError Contains (Text) "Timeout"`
- `RetryFlag Is True`

In this setup, the loop continues if:
- The status is active **and** the retry count is less than 3  
**OR**
- The last error message contains “Timeout” **or** the retry flag is true.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Polling external API** until a certain response is received.
- **Retrying failed workflows** based on error flags and attempt counts.
- **Processing records in a batch** where some items meet a retry condition.
- **Validating form data** until required inputs are filled.
- **Waiting on human approval** until status changes to “Approved”.

## Best Practices

<Callout emoji="✅">
Always keep loops deterministic. Add escape conditions to avoid infinite loops.
</Callout>

- Use logical grouping wisely. Favor **AND** inside a group and **OR** between groups.
- Use `Is Not Empty` and `Exists` checks when waiting on dynamically populated values.
- For list processing, consider using "Repeat for every item in list".
