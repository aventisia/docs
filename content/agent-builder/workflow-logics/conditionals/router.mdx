# Router Node & Branch Conditions

## Overview

The **Router Node** is a powerful control element in the Agent Builder that allows your automation to **branch dynamically** based on conditions you define.  
Think of it as a decision-making node that evaluates data and **routes the workflow accordingly**.

Use this node when you want to guide the execution path based on **data-driven logic**, such as customer type, ticket priority, or process step.

---

## How the Router Works

The Router evaluates one or more **branch conditions** and decides which part(s) of the workflow to execute next.  
Each **branch** contains logic that is executed **only when its condition(s) evaluate to true**.

You configure this logic via:
- **Conditional Mode**
- **Branch Conditions** (values, operators, and logic groups)

---

## Conditional Modes

### 1. **Execute Only the First Matching Branch** (Default)

- Evaluates conditions top-down.
- Stops at the **first matching branch** and executes only that branch.
- Ignores any subsequent branches, even if their conditions also match.
- Ideal for **mutually exclusive** or **prioritized logic**.

**Example**  
Check for “Gold,” “Silver,” and “Bronze” customers.  
If a customer qualifies for both Gold and Silver, only the Gold branch executes.

---

### 2. **Execute All Matching Branches**

- Evaluates all branches.
- Executes **every branch** where conditions are true.
- Ideal when **multiple criteria** may apply and **parallel actions** are needed.

**Example**  
A support ticket is marked both “Urgent” and “Requires Manager Review” — both branches run.

---

## Branch Conditions

Each branch has a **set of conditions** that determine whether it should execute.

### Components of a Condition

- **First Value**: The variable or field to evaluate.
- **Operator**: The rule or comparison method.
- **Second Value**: Optional value to compare against.

---

### Logical Grouping of Conditions

- **+ AND Group**: All conditions in this group must be true.
- **+ OR Group**: At least one condition group must be true.

| Segregate Overdue Payments by Days    | `DueDate Before Today - 30 Days` (30, 60, 90 logic)        |
| Filter Tickets with Specific Tags     | `AssignedTags Contains (List) urgent`                     |
| Ensure Email Field is Provided        | `CustomerEmail Is Not Empty`                              |

## Best Practices

- Order your branches carefully when using **“Execute First Match”**.
- Keep conditions clear and non-overlapping where possible.
- Use **“Execute All”** only when downstream logic supports **parallel execution**.
- Group complex conditions using **AND**/**OR** blocks to match business logic cleanly.
- Test each branch independently before going live.

---

## Pro Tip

Use a **test payload** with different variable sets to ensure the Router behaves as expected across all condition branches.
