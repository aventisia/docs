## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1

Add the **Find and Replace Words in Word Document** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Word Instance** field, specify the Word document instance you want to modify.

### Step 3

Enter the text you want to search for in the **Text to Find** field.

### Step 5

Toggle the **All Matches** switch if you want to replace all occurrences of the text within the document.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Issue                                                   | Solution                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nothing is replaced in the document**                 | Verify that the text in **Text to Find** matches exactly what is in the document, including case if applicable. |
| **Unexpected matches when using wildcards**             | Check your wildcard patterns and ensure they accurately reflect your intended search criteria.                  |
| **Match Case and Match Whole Words Only not appearing** | Ensure **Use Wildcards** is enabled to see these options.                                                       |
