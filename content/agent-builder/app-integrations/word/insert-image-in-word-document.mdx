# Insert Image in Word Document

The **Insert Image in Word Document** node allows you to insert an image into a Microsoft Word document easily. This is helpful when you need to add images for illustrations, branding, or documentation purposes directly into your Word files.

You can choose where in the document the image is insertedâ€”such as at the beginning or end of the document, or near specific bookmarks or text.
