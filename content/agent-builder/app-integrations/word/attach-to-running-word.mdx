# Attach to Running Word

The **Attach to Running Word** node connects to an active Microsoft Word document, allowing you to perform further actions on it. This is particularly useful when you want to automate tasks or extend functionality within an already open Word document.

Use cases include editing, analyzing, or extracting text from an opened document without needing to open a new instance of Word.
