# Save Word

The **Save Word** node is designed to save a Microsoft Word document that you are currently working on. This node is useful when you need to automate the saving process of an open Word document, ensuring that your changes are not lost and can be retrieved later. It's particularly helpful when managing multiple documents or automating repetitive tasks in Word.

For example:

- Automatically save a document in progress to prevent data loss.
- Save a copy of a document under a new name or location.
