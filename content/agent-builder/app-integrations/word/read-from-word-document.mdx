# Read from Word Document

The **Read from Word Document** node allows you to extract content from Microsoft Word files in your workflow automation. This node is particularly useful when you need to process or analyze textual content from Word files, whether it involves retrieving full documents, specific pages, or content marked by bookmarks.

For example:

- Extracting entire document text for review or further processing.
- Pulling specific sections, such as certain pages, for targeted analysis.
- Collecting content marked by bookmarks for data extraction or reporting.
