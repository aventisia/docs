# Write to Word Document

The **Write to Word Document** node lets you add or append text to a Microsoft Word document. This node is helpful when you need to update existing documents with new information, such as adding notes, comments, or continuous updates without manually opening the Word files.

For example:

- Appending meeting minutes to an ongoing Word document.
- Adding dynamic content to pre-existing templates.
- Automatically documenting changes or memos at specific points in your Word files.

### Step 1

Add **Write to Word Document** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Word Instance** field, specify the Word instance you wish to write to. Ensure this instance is correctly opened and accessible.

### Step 3

Enter the text you wish to add in the **Text to Write** field.

Choose where in the document you want the text written by using the **Write Text To** dropdown menu. Options include:

- **Beginning of Word file**: Adds text at the top of the document.
- **End of Word file**: Places text at the document's end.

| **Text appearing in wrong location** | Double-check the selection in **Write Text To** dropdown to ensure the text is placed correctly. Be aware of any pre-existing content formatting. |
