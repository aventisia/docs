# Close Word

The **Close Word** node is used to terminate a specific instance of Microsoft Word. You can choose whether to save any changes made to a document before closing. This is useful when automating tasks that include editing Word documents and you want to ensure they are properly closed, with or without saving changes, to maintain data integrity or to free up system resources.

| **Document changes are lost**   | Always select an appropriate save option in the **Before Closing Word** dropdown to prevent accidental loss of unsaved changes. |
