# Save Outlook Email Messages

The **Save Outlook Email Messages** node is designed to save selected email messages from your Outlook email account onto your computer. This can be particularly useful if you need to back up important emails, share them with others, or store them in a different location for compliance or archival purposes.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Solution                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emails not saving**       | Verify that the **Outlook Application** and **Email Messages** fields are correctly filled out with valid objects and email items.                   |
| **Invalid Save Location**   | Double-check that the folder path is correct and that you have permission to save files there.                                                       |
| **No .msg files generated** | Ensure that email messages are selected properly and that you have not reached any limits on the number of emails that can be processed at one time. |
