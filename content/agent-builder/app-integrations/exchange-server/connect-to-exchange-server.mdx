# Connect to Exchange Server

The **Connect to Exchange Server** node is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of establishing a connection to a Microsoft Exchange server. By customizing a few key settings, such as the version of the Exchange server, connection type, and credentials, you can quickly set up a robust link for managing emails and calendars directly through the Exchange Service object. This node is especially useful for businesses that rely on Exchange Server for their communication needs and want to automate tasks involving Exchange resources.

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is an **Exchange Connection** object, which represents the connection to the Exchange server, allowing you to perform various operations with the Exchange server.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Connect to Exchange Server** node into your workflow.

### Step 2

Select the desired **Exchange Server Version** from the dropdown menu. Ensure that you pick the correct version to match your organization's server setup.

### Step 3

In **Connection Type**, choose how you want to connect:

- **Auto discovery**: Discover the server automatically using an email address.
- **Exchange server address**: Connect using a specific server address.

### Step 4

Depending on the **Connection Type** selected:

- If **Auto discovery**, enter the appropriate **Email Address**.
- If **Exchange server address**, provide the **Server Address**.

### Step 5

Set the **Credentials** option, specifying the authentication method:

- Choose **Exchange default** for default credentials.
- Select **User defined** to provide custom domain, username, and password.

### Step 6

If you selected **User defined** in **Credentials**, fill in:

- **Domain**
- **Username**
- **Password**

### Step 7

Optionally, adjust **Timeout** if you need a custom setting (default is 30 seconds).

### Step 8

The configured node now establishes the connection, and you can use this as **Exchange Connection** in subsequent nodes.

  Ensure all mandatory fields are filled correctly to establish a connection
  successfully. If using **Auto discovery**, ensure your email server supports
  it.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                      | Solution                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid or missing credentials**           | Verify that all credential fields are correctly filled if using **User defined**.     |
| **Server not found using auto discovery**    | Double-check the email address entered and ensure the server supports auto-discovery. |
| **Timeout errors**                           | Increase the timeout value if your server needs more time to establish connections.   |
| **Incorrect Exchange Server Version chosen** | Ensure that the selected version matches your actual server setup.                    |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Automated Email Management**: Establish connections to automate email-sending tasks within a business.
- **Calendar Synchronization**: Use connections to sync and update calendar appointments accurately across systems.
