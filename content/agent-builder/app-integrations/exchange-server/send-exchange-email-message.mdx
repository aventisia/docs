# Send Exchange Email Message

The **Send Exchange Email Message** node enables you to send emails directly through an Exchange server. This is ideal for automating the sending of reports, notifications, or any routine communication without opening an email client. By connecting to your Exchange server, you can specify details like the sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachments of your email message, ensuring a seamless integration into your automated workflows.
