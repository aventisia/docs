# Close Terminal Session

The **Close Terminal Session** node is designed to terminate an active terminal session identified by a specific Session ID. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that remote terminal sessions are closed after completing tasks to maintain security and resource efficiency.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name    | Description                                               | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **SessionId** | The session ID of the terminal session you want to close. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

This node does not produce an output value by itself; it executes an action in the background (i.e., closing the terminal session).

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Close Terminal Session** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **SessionId** field, enter the session ID of the terminal session that you need to close.

### Step 3

The session specified will be closed, completing the node's task.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Important Note">
  Ensure that the **SessionId** entered is correct and active. Closing an
  incorrect session ID might not yield any action or may disrupt another user's
  session inadvertently.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                        | Solution                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No session closed**          | Verify that the **SessionId** is correct and refers to an active session that needs to be closed. |
| **SessionId field left empty** | This field is mandatory; must be filled with a valid session ID before executing the node.        |
| **Unintended session closed**  | Double-check the session ID input to ensure it matches the intended session to be terminated.     |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Security Compliance**: Automatically close terminal sessions to prevent unauthorized access when tasks are completed.
- **Resource Management**: Shut down inactive or unnecessary sessions to free up server resources.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ensure terminal sessions are not left open unintentionally to maintain an organized workflow.
