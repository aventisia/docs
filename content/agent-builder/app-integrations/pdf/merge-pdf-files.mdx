# Merge PDF Files

The **Merge PDF Files** node allows you to combine multiple PDF documents into a single file. This is particularly useful for consolidating reports, presentations, or any documents that need to be viewed as one cohesive file.

For example:

- Combine individual chapters of an eBook into a single document.
- Merge separate project reports into one comprehensive report.
- Compile multiple PDF-based invoices into a single batch for review.
