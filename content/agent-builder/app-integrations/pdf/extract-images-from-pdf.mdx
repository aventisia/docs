# Extract Images from PDF

The **Extract Images from PDF** node is designed to help you automatically extract all images from a PDF file and save them as separate image files in a specified folder. This can be especially useful in situations where you need to analyze, archive, or reuse images from PDF documents without manually going through each file.

For example:

- Quickly extracting images from PDF reports to include in presentations or emails.
- Archiving images from PDF catalogs or brochures for inventory purposes.
- Reusing images from PDF design documents without having to recreate them.
