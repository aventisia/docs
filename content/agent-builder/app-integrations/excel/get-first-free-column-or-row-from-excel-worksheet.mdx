# Get First Free Column or Row from Excel Worksheet

The **Get First Free Column or Row from Excel Worksheet** node helps you quickly identify the first empty column or row in a specific Excel worksheet. This is particularly useful for tasks such as data entry, analysis, and ensuring that new data does not overwrite existing information.

For example:

- Automatically identify where to start entering new data without overwriting existing content.
- Efficiently set up subsequent nodes in your workflow for data input operations.
