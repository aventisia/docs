# Get Active Excel Worksheet

The **Get Active Excel Worksheet** node is designed to help you easily identify the worksheet that is currently active or in use within an Excel application. This is particularly useful when managing multiple worksheets in a workbook and needing to direct workflows or operations to the active sheet specifically.

By using this node, you can automate processes that depend on or specifically target the active sheet in an Excel workbook.
