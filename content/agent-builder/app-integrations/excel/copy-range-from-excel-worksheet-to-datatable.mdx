# Copy Range from Excel Worksheet to DataTable

The **Copy Range from Excel Worksheet to DataTable** node allows you to extract data from a specified range of cells within an Excel worksheet and convert it into a DataTable format. This is useful for situations where you need to manipulate or analyze data from Excel without manually transferring data, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

Typical scenarios include:

- Extracting data for reports based on specific cell ranges.
- Preparing data for further processing or automated workflows.
- Simplifying data integration from Excel to various applications.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Copy Range from Excel Worksheet to DataTable** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Excel Application** field, enter the object reference for the Excel application containing your source worksheet.

### Step 3

Specify the range of cells you want to copy in the **Range to Copy** field. For example, enter a value like 'A1:B10' to define the cell range.

### Step 4

The extracted data will be available as **CopiedData**, displayed as a DataTable, which you can utilize in other nodes or workflows.

## Input/Output Examples

| Excel Application | Range to Copy | Output (DataTable) | Output Type |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| excelApp1         | A1:B10        | CopiedData         | DataTable   |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                 | Solution                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid Excel Application reference** | Verify that the reference to the Excel application is correct and that the application is open and accessible. |
| **Incorrect cell range formatting**     | Make sure the range is formatted correctly (e.g., 'A1:B10'). The range should exist in the worksheet.          |
| **Empty output in CopiedData**          | Check if the specified range actually contains data. An empty range will result in no data being copied.       |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Report Generation**: Automatically copy data from specific Excel workbook sheets to DataTables for use in report generation tools.
- **Data Analysis**: Extract and convert ranges of data from Excel to leverage in data analysis and visualization platforms.
- **Automated Workflows**: Incorporate Excel data into automated systems for scheduling, task management, or real-time data processing.
