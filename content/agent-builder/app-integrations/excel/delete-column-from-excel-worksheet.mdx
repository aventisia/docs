## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                              | Solution                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Excel Application field is empty** | Ensure you reference the correct Excel Application object that contains your target worksheet.                                             |
| **Invalid Column Index entered**     | Double-check the Column Index input for accuracy. Use numeric (1, 2, 3...) or letter (A, B, C...) values to specify the column accurately. |
| **Unintended column deletion**       | Verify the column index carefully before confirming deletion, especially if using numeric inputs which are 1-based.                        |
