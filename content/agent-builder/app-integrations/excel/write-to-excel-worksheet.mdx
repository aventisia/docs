## Expected Output Format

The outcome of this node is not a direct data output. Instead, it reflects the successful modification of cell values in the Excel worksheet, performing a backend action.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Write to Excel Worksheet** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Excel Application** field, specify the Excel Application object that contains the worksheet where you want to write data.

### Step 3

Enter the data in the **Value To Write** field that you wish to insert into the Excel sheet.

### Step 4

Select the **Write Mode** to define how you want to target cells:

- **On Specified Cell**: Write by specifying exact column and row.
- **On Currently Active Cell**: Write to the cell currently in focus.
- **On Named Cells**: Write to cells defined by a named range.

### Step 5

If you choose **On Specified Cell**, fill in the **Column** and **Row** fields with the appropriate cell references.

### Step 6

If you select **On Named Cells**, enter the range in the **Name** field and decide if you'll use **Populate Entire Range** to fill the entire range with the entered value.

### Step 7

Run the flow to automatically write the specified values to your worksheet.
