# Delete FTP Directory

The **Delete FTP Directory** node enables you to remove a directory from an FTP server. This is particularly useful for managing and cleaning up files on remote servers. Use this node when you want to delete unneeded directories to free up space or organize your FTP server.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                | Solution                                                                                                                        |

| **Invalid FTP connection information** | Ensure that your FTP connection details are correct; verify the server address, username, and password.                         |
| **Directory not found**                | Double-check the directory name for typos or errors. Ensure the directory exists on the FTP server before attempting to delete. |
| **Permission denied**                  | Verify that your FTP account has sufficient permissions to delete directories.                                                  |

## Real-World Use Cases
