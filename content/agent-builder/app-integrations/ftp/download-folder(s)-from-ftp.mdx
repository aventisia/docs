# Download Folder(s) from FTP

The **Download Folder(s) from FTP** node allows you to retrieve entire folders from a remote FTP server and store them in a specified local directory. This is particularly useful for automating the process of obtaining large sets of files or maintaining regular backups from FTP servers in an organized manner.

In scenarios where you need to collect project files or data archives periodically from an FTP server for reporting or analysis, this node can efficiently handle bulk folder downloads and ensure they are saved correctly to your intended location.
