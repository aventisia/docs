### Notes
- Multiple folder paths can be specified using a semicolon-separated list (e.g., `C:\Folder1;C:\Folder2`).
- Disabling **Overwrite Files** is safer if you want to avoid accidental replacement.
- FTP timeouts can vary based on server settings and folder sizeâ€”adjust the `Timeout Seconds` field accordingly.
