# Synchronize Directories

The **Synchronize Directories** node enables you to manage files between a local directory and a remote FTP server efficiently. This node allows you to upload, download, or synchronize files in both directions, ensuring that your local and remote file systems are harmonized.

This function is particularly valuable when you need to routinely upload updates from a local project folder to a server or keep local backups of remote server directories.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name                           | Description                                                                                | Input Type | Required? | Default Value          |

| **File Comparison Method**           | Determines how to recognize files that need synchronization.                               | Select     | No        | ByNameAndSize          |
| **Delete Files Not Present Locally** | Deletes files from the remote directory not present in the local directory if set to true. | Switch     | No        | _(empty)_              |
| **Include Subdirectories**           | Includes subdirectories during synchronization if enabled.                                 | Switch     | No        | _(empty)_              |

| **Timeout Seconds**                  | Maximum time in seconds to wait before synchronization times out.                          | Text       | No        | 30                     |

## Expected Output Format

The node returns two pieces of numeric data:

- **Files Transferred**: A number indicating how many files were moved during synchronization.
- **Directories Created**: A number indicating how many directories were created on the remote server.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Synchronize Directories** node to your workflow.

### Step 2

In the **FTP Connection** field, input the FtpClient object that connects to your FTP server.

### Step 3

Enter the path for the **Local Directory** you wish to synchronize with the remote directory.

### Step 4

Enter the path for the **Remote Directory** you wish to synchronize.

### Step 5

Select the desired **Sync Mode** to define how files should be transferred. Options include:

- **Upload**: From local to remote.
- **Download**: From remote to local.
- **Bidirectional**: Both ways.

### Step 6

Choose the **File Comparison Method** to decide how files are compared:

- **By Name and Size**: Compares both.
- **By Name Only**: Only names.
- **By Name and Date**: Names and modification dates.

### Step 7

(Optional) Set the **Delete Files Not Present Locally** switch to true if you want to remove remote files not found locally.

### Step 8

(Optional) Enable **Include Subdirectories** if you want to include them in the sync process.

### Step 9

Select an **Overwrite Mode** to determine when files should be overwritten:

- **Always**, **Never**, **If newer**, **If size different**, **If newer or size different**.

### Step 10

Set the **Timeout Seconds** to limit how long the synchronization process should attempt before timing out.

### Step 11

After configuration, the synchronization will execute. You can view the **Files Transferred** and **Directories Created** outputs for details.

## Input/Output Examples

| Local Directory | Remote Directory | Sync Mode | Files Transferred | Directories Created |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| /local/path     | /remote/path     | Upload    | 10                | 2                   |
| /local/backup   | /remote/backup   | Download  | 5                 | 1                   |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                    | Solution                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incorrect FTP Connection**               | Verify your FTP credentials and connection string.                                |
| **Cannot find directory path**             | Ensure that the specified local and remote paths exist and are accurate.          |
| **Unexpected overwrites or missing files** | Review your sync settings and overwrite modes.                                    |
| **Timeout errors**                         | Increase **Timeout Seconds** if larger datasets or slow connections are expected. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Remote Website Updates**: Automatically update live website files from a local development environment.
- **Data Backup**: Keep a synchronized backup of important server directories locally.
- **Data Collation**: Combine data from various sources into a central repository using Bidirectional syncing.
