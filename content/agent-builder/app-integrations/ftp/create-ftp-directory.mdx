# Create FTP Directory

The **Create FTP Directory** node is a tool designed to streamline the creation of new directories on an FTP server. It allows you to specify a directory name and establish a connection to your FTP server. This can be invaluable when organizing files, setting up new storage areas, or preparing directories for data upload.

Use this node when you need to efficiently manage directories on your FTP server without manually accessing the server interface.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Solution                                                                                    |
