# Rename FTP File

The **Rename FTP File** node is designed to change the name of a file stored on a remote FTP server. Use this node when you need to organize files on your FTP server by renaming them in a structured manner, ensuring consistency in file naming conventions or simply updating outdated file names.

This feature is particularly useful for tasks such as:

- Renaming files before processing them in subsequent workflows.
- Harmonizing file names according to updated naming standards.
- Preparing files for download or further actions by a different department or team.

## Expected Output Format

The output is a **success indicator** as a boolean value:

- **True**: Indicates the file has been successfully renamed.
- **False**: Indicates the file could not be renamed.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Rename FTP File** node to your flow.

### Step 2

In the **FTP Connection** field, enter your FTP server connection details.

### Step 3

Provide the **Old File Name** that you want to change.

### Step 4

Enter the new desired name in the **New File Name** field.

### Step 5

Optionally, set your preference for **Timeout Seconds** to specify how long to wait for the operation before timing out (default is 30 seconds).

### Step 6

Once the setup is complete, the node will attempt to rename the file. Check the **Success** output to confirm the operation was performed correctly.

| **Connection Errors** | Ensure the FTP connection details are correct, including the complete FTP address and credentials. |
| **File Not Found**    | Double-check the **Old File Name** to make sure it matches exactly with the one on the server.     |
| **Timeout Issues**    | Increase the **Timeout Seconds** if the server response is slow or there are network delays.       |

## Real-World Use Cases
