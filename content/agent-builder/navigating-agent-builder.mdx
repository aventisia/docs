# Getting started with Agent Builder
Understand the basics and start building a Agent.

Flow Builder gives you complete control and flexibility to automate or build out virtually any process. Let's dive-in to understand the basics and get you started on building your first Agent.

## What are Agents?
Agents are created in a visual Agent builder. You can design powerful, intricate, and time-saving systems that can be iterated on demand.

Whether you're looking to automate repetitive tasks, create a new process, or implement a comprehensive data integration system, Agents have you covered. From sales to marketing, to  operations, if you can think it, you can build it with our Agent builder.

## Components of a Agent
Understanding the components of a Agent will give you a clearer picture of how to create, run, and refine your processes:

+ **Canvas**: This is your primary workspace, where you'll piece together the different blocks of your Agent.

+ **Triggers**: This defines when your workflow starts and what data will be passed into it. It could be an event, like a new record being created, or maybe a specific date and time or any other custom trigger you define.

+ **Activity**: Think of these as individual actions or steps in your Agent. They can range from sending emails, updating attributes, to even more complex operations. [See all actions available in our Activities library]().

+ **Paths**: These are the connectors between activities, dictating the flow and sequence of actions within your Agent.

+ **Inputs**: Information or data that is required for a activity to run.

+ **Variables**: These are dynamic input values. For instance, the name of a new customer to use in subsequent steps. The value will be different for every run of the Agent.

+ **Runs**: Each execution of a Agent is called a 'run'. This can help you track individual instances of a Agent.

+ **Credits**: Consider these as the fuel for your Agent. The complexity of a Agent determines the number of credits consumed per run. More intricate Agents will require more credits.

+ **Templates**: Pre-built flows that you can utilize as starting points or inspiration.

+ **Notes**: Use notes to add more information about your Agent or link to documentation.

## Building a Agent
To build a Agent you can either start from scratch or use a template. Here's a step-by-step guide:

+ **Choose your starting point**:

  + Begin with a blank canvas for full customization.

  + Or, use one of the available templates to get a head start.


+ **Choose a trigger**: Determine when your Agent should kick off and what data get passed to each run.

+ **Add activities**: Hover over your trigger and click the + icon to add the next activity to your canvas. [See our Activity library]()

+ **Set inputs**: Define the data each activity needs to execute correctly in the configuration panel that pops-up when you choose an activity.

+ **Deleting activities**: Simply select the unwanted activity and hit backspace or click delete.

+ **Reordering activities**: Select the paths you’d like to remove and hit backspace. Click and drag the blue connecting node to another activity to create a new path.

+ **Publishing**: Click Publish to take your Agent out of the draft stage and allow it to be run when the trigger condition is met.

+ **Pausing**: Click the published toggle to pause a Agent and stop it running.

## Running a Agent
There are two ways to run a Agent:

1. **Automatically**: Set up conditions that when met cause the Agent to run automatically, without any manual intervention. Often this is on the creation or update of a piece of data.

2. **Manually**: Choose this when you need to execute a Agent on-demand. The Execute trigger on the top-left side on the screen will let you do this.

**⁠Congratulations!** You are now equipped with the foundational knowledge to harness the power of Agents. As you continue to explore and experiment, remember that Agents provides a canvas to bring your unique visions for automations and process designs to life. Happy building!
