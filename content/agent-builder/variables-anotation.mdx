# Use variables and the % notation

In this article, you will study:

+ Hardcoded values
+ Using blank values
+ Variable names
+ Basic arithmatic
+ Comparissons
+ Logical Operators
+ Parentheses

Variables are used within flows to store data for further processing. 
Every variable name must be enclosed by percentage signs (**%**). 
The percentage sign is used as a special character to denote variables. 
Any expression between percentage signs should be evaluated.

Occasionally, the percentage sign should be used as a simple character, 
instead of denoting a calculation. In those cases, it should be escaped using another percentage character (%%).

Aventisia enables you to create complex expressions containing hardcoded values, 
variable names, arithmetic and logical operations, comparisons and parentheses.

## Hardcoded values

To include a hardcoded text value inside a variable, use quotes. 
Every value between the quote characters will be treated as a text value and not as a variable name.

## Using blank values

Variables can receive null (empty) values. Any variable, dynamic or not, including nested properties, 
can be populated with a **Blank** value. To check whether a variable holds a blank value use the **Is blank** or **Is not blank** options when configuring the respective [conditional actions]


> [!NOTE]
> Some action parameters can be assigned a blank value if the input argument is nullable. 
If the parameter can't receive a blank value, an error occurs.

## Variable names

Variables can be used by adding their name to the expression without any further notation.



## Basic arithmetic

To make mathematical operations, use all the essential, arithmetic operators, such as addition (**+**), subtraction (**-**), multiplication (**\***), and division (**/**).

Arithmetic operations are predominantly used with numerical values and variables. However, you can also use the addition operator to concatenate strings. 
Adding numbers and text strings in the same expression will convert the numbers into text, and concatenate them with the other text strings.

| Expression                  | Result                                              | Result variable type |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| %5 * 3%                     | 15                                                  | Number               |
| %4 / Var%                   | 4 divided by the value of the Variable named “Var”  | Number               |
| %'this is ' + 'text'%       | this is text                                        | Text                 |
| %'This is the number ' + 5% | This is the number 5                                | Text                 |

## Comparisons

Besides arithmetic operators, make comparisons using the following operators
