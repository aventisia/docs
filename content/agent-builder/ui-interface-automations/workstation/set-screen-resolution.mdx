# Set Screen Resolution

The **Set Screen Resolution** node allows you to specify and adjust the resolution settings of a display device connected to your computer. This includes setting the width, height, bit count, and refresh rate (frequency) for one specific monitor or for all monitors. This node is useful when you need to ensure a particular display setup is maintained, such as in presentations, software testing, or adjusting for specific application requirements.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name    | Description                                                                                                                | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **Display**   | The name or number of the display to set resolution for. Use 'Primary' for the primary monitor, or 'All' for all monitors. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Width**     | The width of the screen.                                                                                                   | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Height**    | The height of the screen.                                                                                                  | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Bit Count** | The bit count of the screen, indicating color depth.                                                                       | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Frequency** | The frequency (refresh rate) of the screen, indicating how many times the screen is refreshed per second.                  | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

The node does not generate a separate output value to be used in other nodes. Instead, it directly alters the screen resolution settings of the specified display device(s).

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Set Screen Resolution** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Display** field, specify which monitor you want to adjust. Use 'Primary' to target the main monitor or 'All' to apply changes to every connected monitor.

### Step 3

Enter the desired screen dimensions in **Width** and **Height** fields, respectively, to define the resolution.

### Step 4

Specify the **Bit Count** to set the color depth of the display.

### Step 5

Enter the **Frequency** to define the refresh rate, ensuring smoother image changes.

</Steps>

  Ensure that the resolution settings you input are supported by your monitor(s)
  to avoid display issues.

## Input/Output Examples

While the **Set Screen Resolution** node does not produce an output value, it modifies the display properties as inputted. For example:

- **Display**: 'Primary'
- **Width**: '1920'
- **Height**: '1080'
- **Bit Count**: '32'
- **Frequency**: '60'

In this case, the primary display would be set to a resolution of 1920x1080, with a 32-bit color depth and a refresh rate of 60Hz.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                             | Solution                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Incorrect Display Specification** | Verify that you correctly specify the display name as 'Primary', 'All', or as a particular display number.               |
| **Unsupported Resolution Settings** | Check the monitor's documentation to ensure your input values for resolution and frequency are supported.                |
| **No Visual Changes After Setting** | Ensure that all required fields are accurately filled and refresh settings through the OS display settings if necessary. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Switch Configurations for Presentation**: Quickly adjust screen resolution settings for better visibility and formatting during presentations.
- **Software Testing and Development**: Set specific configurations to test applications on different screen resolutions and refresh rates.
- **Optimize Display for Multimedia**: Adjust resolution and refresh rate to enhance viewing experiences for videos and games.
