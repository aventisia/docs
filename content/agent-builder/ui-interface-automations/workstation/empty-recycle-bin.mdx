# Empty Recycle Bin

The **Empty Recycle Bin** node enables you to clear out the contents of the recycle bin on your computer. You can choose to empty the recycle bin for just your current user or for all users if you have administrative privileges. This node is helpful for freeing up disk space and decluttering deleted files that you no longer need.

This can be particularly useful:

- After uninstalling programs or deleting large files to immediately reclaim disk space.
- To maintain privacy by ensuring deleted files are cleared away completely.
- To automate regular cleanups of the recycle bin as part of system maintenance routines.
