# Play Sound

The **Play Sound** node allows you to trigger audio output in your automation workflow. By using this node, you can play either a system sound or a custom WAV file. This can be useful for creating audible alerts, notifications, or enhancing the user experience with sound effects in desktop automations.

For example:

- Playing a notification sound when an important task completes.
- Using customized sounds to differentiate between stages of a workflow.
- Alerting users audibly when an action requires attention.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name          | Description                                                                              | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |

| **System Sound**    | (Appears only if "Play Sound From" is set to "System") Name of the system sound to play. | Select     | No        | _(empty)_     |
| **WAV File Path**   | (Appears only if "Play Sound From" is set to "WAV file") The path to the WAV file.       | Text       | No        | _(empty)_     |
| **Play Mode**       | Decide how the sound should be played: synchronously, asynchronously, or repeatedly.     | Select     | No        | Sync          |
| **Volume**          | The volume level (0-100) only for system sounds.                                         | Text       | No        | 100           |

## Expected Output Format

The node outputs two pieces of information:

- **Played**: A status text indicating if the sound was played successfully.
- **Duration**: The sound's duration in milliseconds, if available.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Play Sound** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Play Sound From** dropdown, choose one of the following options:

- **System**: To play a predefined system sound.
- **WAV file**: To play a custom WAV file using its file path.

### Step 3

If you selected "System":

- Go to the **System Sound** dropdown and pick the desired system sound.

If you selected "WAV file":

- Enter the full file path of the WAV file in the **WAV File Path** field.

### Step 4

In the **Play Mode** dropdown, select how you want to play the sound:

- **Synchronous**: The flow will wait until the sound finishes playing.
- **Asynchronous**: The flow continues immediately, without waiting.
- **Repeat**: The sound will play continuously.

### Step 5

Set the **Volume** level (only applicable for system sounds) between 0 to 100.

### Step 6

Once configured, run the flow to play the sound. You will receive an output with the status and optionally the duration in milliseconds.

  If you are not hearing the sound, check your systemâ€™s volume settings or
  verify that the WAV file path is correct.

## Input/Output Examples

| Play Sound From | System Sound | WAV File Path       | Play Mode | Volume  | Played | Duration |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| System          | Beep         | _(n/a)_             | Sync      | 80      | Played | _n/a_    |
| WAV file        | _(n/a)_      | C:/sounds/alert.wav | Async     | _(n/a)_ | Played | 3000     |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                           | Solution                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sound not playing**             | Ensure the correct option (System or WAV file) is selected and the file path is accurate.                   |
| **Volume adjustment not working** | The volume setting only affects system sounds, not WAV files.                                               |
| **Fields not appearing**          | Make sure "Play Sound From" is set correctly to display relevant options (System vs. WAV file path fields). |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Task Completion Notifications**: Notify users with a sound when a long-running process finishes.
- **Error Alerts**: Play a warning or error sound when an incorrect input is detected in the workflow.
- **Custom Greetings**: Use personalized sounds or music to welcome users in interactive desktop environments.
