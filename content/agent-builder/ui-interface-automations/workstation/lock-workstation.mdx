# Lock Workstation

The **Lock Workstation** node is designed to help you secure your computer swiftly by locking it. This is particularly useful in environments where leaving your workstation unlocked could pose security risks or when stepping away from your desk.

For example:

- Immediately locking your station when you leave a shared workspace.
- Ensuring sensitive data isn't accessible to unauthorized viewers while you're away.
- Saving the hassle of manually locking your workstation each time.
