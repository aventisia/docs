# Control Screensaver

The **Control Screensaver** node allows you to manage the behavior of your computer's screensaver by enabling, disabling, starting, or stopping it. This can be useful in situations where you need the screen to remain active for a presentation or where security policies require the screensaver to be enabled after a certain period of inactivity.

| **Timeout not effective when screensaver enabled** | Double-check the value entered in the **Time Out Seconds** field. Ensure it's a numeric value. |
| **Screensaver doesn't start/stop as expected**     | Verify system permissions and confirm manual control over the screensaver is possible.         |

- **Security Compliance**: Enable the screensaver with a timeout to ensure systems lock automatically after inactivity for security compliance.
- **User Convenience**: Start or stop screensavers based on user activity to customize the user experience.
