# Log Off User

The **Log Off User** node is designed to allow you to log off a session on a Windows computer. This can be useful for ensuring that user sessions are properly terminated, freeing system resources, or preparing a system for shutdown. It offers various methods to perform the logoff operation and can forcefully close applications if they do not respond, ensuring a smooth logoff process.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name          | Description                                                                           | Input Type | Required? | Default Value   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- |
| **Logoff Method**   | Choose the method to use when logging off: Shutdown Command, Windows API, or WTS API. | Select     | No        | ShutdownCommand |
| **Force Logoff**    | Option to force logoff if applications don't respond.                                 | Switch     | No        | False           |
| **Timeout Seconds** | Number of seconds to wait before forcing logoff if applications don't respond.        | Text       | No        | 30              |

## Expected Output Format

The node will produce a **Boolean** output, indicating whether the logoff was successfully initiated. The output is titled **Success** and will be `true` if the operation begins properly.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Log Off User** node to your automation flow.

### Step 2

In the **Logoff Method** dropdown, choose how you want the system to perform the logoff. You have three options:

- **Shutdown Command**: Uses the built-in shutdown.exe command.
- **Windows API**: Utilizes the ExitWindowsEx function from the Windows API.
- **WTS API**: Employs the Terminal Services API for logoff.

### Step 3

Decide if you need to force the logoff. Toggle the **Force Logoff** switch:

- **On**: Forces logoff, useful if applications are unresponsive.
- **Off**: Attempts a regular logoff, allowing time for apps to close.

### Step 4

If you activated **Force Logoff**, set the **Timeout Seconds**. This is how long (in seconds) the system will wait before forcing the logoff.

### Step 5

Once configured, the operation initiates, and you can use the **Success** output to check if the logoff process started successfully.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  Itâ€™s often best to avoid using **Force Logoff** unless absolutely necessary,
  as it may cause unsaved data to be lost.

## Input/Output Examples

| Logoff Method    | Force Logoff | Timeout Seconds | Success (Output) |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Shutdown Command | Off          | _(n/a)_         | true             |
| Windows API      | On           | 45              | true             |
| WTS API          | On           | 30              | true             |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                    | Solution                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logoff not occurring**                   | Check that the method selected is compatible with your system and that you have the necessary permissions.             |
| **Force Logoff timeout too short**         | Ensure **Timeout Seconds** is sufficient for your applications to respond, especially if they perform save operations. |
| **Successful message but still logged in** | Verify all processes are closing; some may become stuck and require attention beyond the automated action.             |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Scheduled System Maintenance**: Log off users to ensure all processes are ended before maintenance activities.
- **Shared Computer Environments**: Use in libraries or labs for regular session management.
- **Automated Recovery Plans**: As part of a recovery protocol, log off users before system reboots or shutdowns.
