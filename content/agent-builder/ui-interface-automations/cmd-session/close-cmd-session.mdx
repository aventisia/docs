# Close CMD Session

The **Close CMD Session** node allows you to properly terminate an open Command Prompt (CMD) session that was previously started. This is useful for ensuring that any resources or processes associated with the CMD session are released and closed properly. It's typically used as a step to maintain orderly automation workflows without leaving inactive sessions open.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name      | Description                                                      | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **CMD Session** | The process representing the open CMD session you wish to close. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

The **Close CMD Session** node does not produce a direct output value; instead, it performs an action that terminates the specified CMD session.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Close CMD Session** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **CMD Session** field, input the identifier for the CMD session you need to close. This is usually provided by a prior node that created or handled the CMD session.

### Step 3

Execute your workflow to close the specified CMD session.

</Steps>

  Ensure that the **CMD Session** field is filled correctly with the appropriate
  session identifier to avoid closing the wrong session.
</Callout>

## Input/Output Examples

This node focuses on actions rather than data input and output. Ensure that the correct CMD session identifier is used as input for successful operation.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                            | Solution                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid CMD Session Identifier** | Make sure the session identifier is correct and exists. Check against the node that initiated it.  |
| **Session Not Closing**            | Verify that the session was not already closed or that the identifier points to an active session. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Resource Management**: Automatically close CMD sessions after completion of automation tasks to free system resources.
- **Workflow Completion**: Ensure all processes are properly terminated at the end of a workflow, preventing issues in continuous automation environments.
