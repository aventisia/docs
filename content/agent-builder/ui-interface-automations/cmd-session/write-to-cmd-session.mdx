# Write to CMD Session

The **Write to CMD Session** node allows you to send commands directly to an open Command Prompt (CMD) session. This can be useful for automating command-line tasks like running scripts, managing files, or checking system info without manual input. With this node, you can streamline workflows that require CMD operations by automating the command execution process.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name                        | Description                                               | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **CMD Session**                   | The process representing the open CMD session.            | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Command**                       | The command to execute in the CMD session.                | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Send &lt;Enter> After Command** | Specifies whether to send an Enter key after the command. | Switch     | No        | true          |

## Expected Output Format

There is no direct output from this node. The primary function is sending a command to the CMD session. Any command output will appear in the CMD session itself.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Write to CMD Session** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **CMD Session** field, specify the session of the CMD where the command will be sent.

### Step 3

In the **Command** field, enter the command you want to execute in the CMD session.

### Step 4

Toggle **Send &lt;Enter> After Command** if you want the command to automatically execute as if you pressed Enter.

### Step 5

Once configured, the command will execute within the CMD session when the node runs in your flow.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Solution                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CMD Session field is empty**           | Make sure you identify the correct CMD session to execute your command.           |
| **Command does not execute as expected** | Verify the command syntax and ensure it is compatible with CMD.                   |
| **Output not seen**                      | Check the CMD window for the result of the command, or redirect output to a file. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Automated Script Execution**: Use the node to run scripts or batch files in scheduled tasks or workflows.
- **System Monitoring**: Automate retrieval of system data or logs using standard CMD utilities.
- **File Management**: Automate tasks like moving, copying, or renaming files using CMD commands.
- **Environment Configuration**: Change system settings or configurations directly through commands.
