# Zip Files

The **Zip Files** node enables you to compress multiple files or entire folders into a single zip file. This function is useful for reducing file size, organizing multiple files into one package, or preparing files for easy sharing and transfer.

For example:

- Combining several related documents into a single zip file for distribution.
- Archiving data folders into a compressed format to save storage space.
- Preparing files for quick and secure upload to servers or emails.
