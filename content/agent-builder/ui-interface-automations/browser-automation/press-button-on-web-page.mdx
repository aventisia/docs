# Press Button on Web Page

The **Press Button on Web Page** node enables you to automate the clicking of a button on a web page within a designated web browser instance. This is ideal for scenarios where you need to simulate a button press, such as submitting forms, logging into a website, or navigating between pages automatically.

## Expected Output Format

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Press Button on Web Page** node to your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Web Browser Instance** field, specify the browser instance variable that you are working with.

### Step 3

Select the **Find Type** from the dropdown menu to define how the button on the page will be located. Options include XPath, Id, Css Selector, among others.

### Step 4

In the **Value To Find** field, enter the specific path or identifier for the button you wish to press.

### Step 5

(Optional) If you want the process to wait for the next page to load after pressing the button, ensure **Wait for Page Load** is set to True, and define a **Timeout for Page Load** in seconds.

### Step 6

(Optional) Configure **Handle Dialog** if you anticipate a dialog appearing after the button press, and specify the **Dialog Button to Press** if applicable.

### Step 7

Complete your flow, and the configuration will act upon executing to press the intended button.
