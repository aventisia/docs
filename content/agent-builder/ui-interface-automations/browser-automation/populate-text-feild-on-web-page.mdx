## Fields and Options  

### 1. Web Browser Instance
- Select the web browser instance where the text field is located.  
- This ensures the action is performed on the correct browser session.  

### 2. Find Type
- Specify the text field (UI element) to populate (e.g., input field, search box).  

### 3. Value To Find
- Enter the text to populate in the text field.  

### 4. Text To Populate
- Choose how to handle non-empty text fields:  
  - **Replace Text**: Replace the existing text with the new text.  

### 5. Input Mode
- Specifies whether to use plain text or secure string input.
  - **Plain Text**
  - **Encrypted Text**

### 6. Field Content Action
- Specifies what to do if the text field already has content.
  - **Replace Text**
  - **Append Text**

### 7. Wait For Element
- If true, waits for the element to appear before typing.

### 8. Timeout for Webpage to Load
- Set the maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the page to load (e.g., `60` seconds).  

### 9. Emulate Typing
- Choose how to populate the text field:  
  - **Fill at Once**: Set the value of the text box instantly.  
  - **Emulate Typing**: Send characters one by one to simulate user typing.  
  - **Note**: This method is slower but required for complex web pages where instant population doesn't work.  

### 10. Use Physical Keystrokes
- Enable this option to emulate physical keystrokes when populating the text field.  
- This is useful for cases where standard text population doesn't trigger the intended action on the element.  
- Note: This option requires the browser window to be focused and will bring it to the foreground automatically.  

### 11. Unfocus After Typing
- Choose whether to unfocus the text box after filling it with text:
  - **True**: Unfocus the text box immediately after filling it.  
  - **False**: Keep the text box focused (useful for scraping autocompletion lists).  

### 12. Wait for Page to Load
- Enable this option to wait for the web page to load completely after populating the text field.  

## Use Cases
- Automating form filling by populating text fields with specific data.  
- Handling non-empty fields by replacing existing text.  
- Using physical keystrokes for cases where standard text population fails to trigger required actions.  

## Summary
The **Populate Text Field on Web Page** action provides a way to populate text fields on web pages with specified text. It includes options to handle non-empty fields and emulate physical keystrokes, ensuring reliable and accurate text input during automation workflows.
