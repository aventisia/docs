## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                     | Solution                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Element not found**                       | Verify the **Find Type** and **Value To Find** are correct and match an existing radio button.          |
| **Page load timeout**                       | Increase the **Timeout for Page Load** if the webpage is slow to load or consider optimizing the page.  |
