# Wait for Shortcut Key

The **Wait for Shortcut Key** node allows you to pause the execution of your workflow until a specified shortcut key is pressed. It's useful when you need the flow to await user input via keyboard shortcuts, ensuring that actions are synchronized with user commands.

For example:

- Awaiting a user to press 'Ctrl + S' for saving actions.
- Waiting for a specific key combination like 'Alt + F4' to trigger a shutdown sequence.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name              | Description                                                                          | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **Shortcut Keys**       | The list of shortcut keys to wait for.                                               | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Continue on Timeout** | If set to true, it proceeds with the flow after a certain time if no key is pressed. | Switch     | No        | False         |
| **Timeout (seconds)**   | Maximum time in seconds to wait for the shortcut key to be pressed.                  | Text       | No        | 0             |

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is a **numeric index** that signifies which shortcut key was pressed from your list (0-based index).

- If 'Ctrl + S' is the first in your list and pressed: output is `0`.
- Index is returned if a key is recognized within the timeout period.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Wait for Shortcut Key** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Shortcut Keys** textbox, specify the key or combination of keys you want to monitor. Example: "Ctrl + S, Alt + F4".

### Step 3

Toggle **Continue on Timeout** if you want the flow to automatically continue after a set timeout period.

### Step 4

Enter the desired number of seconds in the **Timeout (seconds)** field to define how long to wait before timing out.

### Step 5

The index of the shortcut key pressed will be available as **IndexOfShortcutKeyPressed** for use in subsequent nodes.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  If you leave **Timeout (seconds)** at the default value `0`, the node will
  wait indefinitely until a key is pressed.

## Input/Output Examples

| Shortcut Keys              | Continue on Timeout | Timeout (seconds) | Key Pressed | Output Index       | Output Type |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Ctrl + S, Alt + F4         | False               | 0                 | Ctrl + S    | 0                  | Number      |
| Ctrl + S, Alt + F4         | True                | 10                | Alt + F4    | 1                  | Number      |
| Ctrl + P, Shift + Ctrl + Z | True                | 5                 | _(Timeout)_ | _(flow continues)_ | N/A (flow)  |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                      | Solution                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flow doesn't continue**    | Ensure **Continue on Timeout** is enabled and **Timeout (seconds)** is properly set if you want the flow to proceed without keypress. |
| **Wrong key index returned** | Double-check your list in **Shortcut Keys** to ensure correct order and expected key combinations.                                    |
| **Indefinite wait**          | Set a **Timeout (seconds)** if infinite waiting is not desired.                                                                       |

## Real-World Use Cases
