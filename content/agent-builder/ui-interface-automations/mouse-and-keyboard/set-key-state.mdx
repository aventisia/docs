# Set Key State

The **Set Key State** node allows you to change the state of certain keys on your keyboard, specifically the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock keys. This can be particularly useful for automating keyboard-related tasks where you need to ensure that these keys are set to a specific state (On or Off) without manual intervention.

By using this node, you can automate tasks such as:

- Ensuring that Caps Lock is off while inputting passwords.
- Verifying that Num Lock is on for numeric data entry.
- Disabling Scroll Lock to maintain scroll functionality in spreadsheets.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                        | Solution                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No visible change in key state**             | Ensure your keyboard keys function correctly and there's no physical damage or misbehavior. |
| **Incorrect key being modified**               | Double-check that you've selected the correct key and state in the configuration options.   |
| **Automation not triggering the state change** | Confirm the node is properly connected and triggered within your automation flow.           |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Password Input**: Automatically turn off Caps Lock to avoid common password entry errors.
- **Data Entry**: Ensure Num Lock is activated for sessions involving numeric keypad usage.
- **Spreadsheet Navigation**: Deactivate Scroll Lock to enhance navigation efficiency in Excel sheets.
