# If Process

The **If Process** node checks the status of a specific process on your system. It can determine whether a process is currently running or not, and can also specify if the process is running under a certain user. This node is useful for automating tasks based on the status of certain applications or system processes.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                      | Solution                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Condition not set**        | Ensure that you select a valid option from the **Condition** dropdown. It is a required field.                                                                         |
| **Process Name not chosen**  | Select a process from the **Process Name** dropdown to monitor its status.                                                                                             |
| **User Name not applicable** | If you want to check process status under a specific user, make sure the **From User** toggle is on before entering a user name.                                       |
| **Unexpected results**       | Double-check that the correct process and condition are selected, especially when processes may have specific access or restrictions for certain users or permissions. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **System Monitoring**: Automatically check if crucial system services like "Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation" are running and take action if they're not.
- **Application Monitoring**: Ensure that an important application, like "Google Chrome Browser", is running as needed for certain tasks or workflows.
- **User-Specific Operations**: Check if a specific application or service is running under a particular user, useful for administrative or multi-user systems.
