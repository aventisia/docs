# Delete Windows Environment Variable

The **Delete Windows Environment Variable** node is used to remove an environment variable from your Windows operating system. Environment variables are dynamic values that can affect the way processes run on your computer. By deleting an environment variable, you can prevent it from influencing any processes or applications.

This is useful when:

- You need to remove outdated or unnecessary variables.
- You want to ensure certain configurations are reset or removed.
- It's necessary to troubleshoot issues caused by incorrect variables.
