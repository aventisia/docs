# Empty Folder

The **Empty Folder** node enables you to automatically delete all contents within a specified folder on your computer. This includes files and, optionally, any subfolders and their contents. Such functionality is useful for regularly cleaning up directories to save space or to ensure certain folders are ready for new files without manually clearing them each time.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **Empty Folder** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **Folder to Empty** field, enter the full path of the folder you want to clear.

### Step 3

Toggle the **Include Subfolders** switch depending on your preference:

| **Path Not Recognized**             | Ensure the folder path is correct and accessible. Double-check for typos or permission issues.                  |
| **Unintended Data Loss**            | Verify if the **Include Subfolders** setting matches your intent to prevent unintended deletions.               |
| **Node Not Performing as Expected** | Confirm the node is correctly configured and check the folder path for accessibility before executing the flow. |

- **Temporary Data Purge**: Regularly clear project folders of temporary processing files without entering each directory manually.
- **Email Attachments**: Automatically clear out an email attachments folder to ensure it is ready for new incoming files.
