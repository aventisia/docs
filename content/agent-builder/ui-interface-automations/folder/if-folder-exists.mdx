# If Folder Exists

The **If Folder Exists** node allows you to check whether a specific folder exists or does not exist on your desktop or system. This node is helpful if you need to verify folder presence as a trigger or condition in your automation tasks.

For example:

- Confirm that a folder exists before saving files into it.
- Ensure a folder does not exist to prevent overwriting data.

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is a **Boolean value** (`true` or `false`).

- `true`: The condition (Exists/Does Not Exist) is met.
- `false`: The condition is not met.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1

Add **If Folder Exists** node to your flow.

### Step 2

In the **If Folder** dropdown, select the condition you want to check:

- **Doesn't Exist**: Verify that the folder is absent.

### Step 3

In the **Folder Path** field, enter the complete path of the folder you wish to check.

### Step 4

The result, indicating if the folder meets the condition, will be available as **Result** for use in other nodes.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Data Archiving**: Check if a backup folder already exists before archiving data to avoid duplications.
- **Workflow Pre-checks**: Ensure required folders are created before executing file operations in a workflow.
- **Safety Checks**: Verify that a specific folder does not exist before creating it to prevent data overwriting.
