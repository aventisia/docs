# Delete Folder

The **Delete Folder** node allows you to remove a specified folder from your file system. This is particularly useful in workflow automation when you need to ensure that old, unnecessary, or temporary folders are cleaned up during batch processes or scheduled tasks.

For example:

- Clearing out a temporary directory after processing.
- Automatically removing outdated folders based on certain criteria.
- Organizing your workspace by deleting unneeded folders.
