# Move Folder

The **Move Folder** node allows you to transfer a folder from one location to another on your computer. This feature is useful when reorganizing files, backing up data, or preparing folders for processing or sharing.

For example:

- Moving a project folder to an archive directory.
- Transferring a folder to a shared network location for team access.
- Reorganizing folders for improved file management.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                            | Solution                                                                                                            |

| **Invalid path entered**           | Double-check the folder paths you entered. Paths must be valid and correctly formatted.                             |
| **Insufficient permissions error** | Ensure you have the required permissions to read from the source and write to the destination folder.               |
| **Folder not moving**              | Verify that the destination path is accessible and that no other process is using the folder you're trying to move. |
