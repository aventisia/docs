# Wait For File

The **Wait For File** node is designed to monitor your computer's file system for specific changes. It pauses the execution of your automation until a selected file is either created or deleted, based on your specified conditions. This node is particularly helpful in workflows where the presence or absence of a file signals the next step in the process.

For instance, use this when you need to pause until a report is generated or to wait for a temporary file to be removed as a signal to proceed.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name                  | Description                                                                                                  | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **File Path**               | The full path of the file to wait for.                                                                       | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |
| **Wait for File to be**     | Specifies whether to wait for file creation or deletion.                                                     | Select     | No        | Create        |
| **Fail with Timeout Error** | Enable this to fail the activity if the file does not appear within the specified duration.                  | Switch     | No        | false         |
| **Duration (seconds)**      | The maximum time to wait for the file before timing out. Only shows if 'Fail with Timeout Error' is enabled. | Text       | No        | 5             |

## Expected Output Format

This node outputs a **boolean value** indicating whether the file change (creation or deletion) was detected within the specified conditions.

- `true`: The file was successfully created or deleted as specified.
- `false`: The file did not meet the specified conditions within the allotted time.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Wait For File** node into your automation flow.

### Step 2

In the **File Path** field, enter the complete file path you wish to monitor. Ensure the path is correct and accessible.

### Step 3

Use the **Wait for File to be** dropdown to choose whether you are waiting for the file to be "Created" or "Deleted".

### Step 4

To handle situations where the file change may not happen, toggle the **Fail with Timeout Error** switch to enable or disable this option.

### Step 5

If you chose to enable **Fail with Timeout Error**, specify the **Duration (seconds)** to set a maximum wait time.

### Step 6

Once configured, proceed with the rest of your flow. The node will wait accordingly and produce a boolean output reflecting the result.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  If waiting indefinitely isn't an option, ensure you enable "Fail with Timeout
  Error" to control the flow's responsiveness.

## Input/Output Examples

| File Path                | Wait Mode | Timeout Enabled | Duration (sec) | Output |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| `C:\Reports\Summary.txt` | Created   | Yes             | 10             | true   |
| `C:\Temp\RemoveMe.tmp`   | Deleted   | No              | _(n/a)_        | false  |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                              | Solution                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incorrect File Path**              | Double-check the file path for typos or incorrect directory references. Verify the file is accessible by the application. |
| **File not detected within timeout** | Ensure the timeout duration is sufficient for the file operation expected. Consider adjusting the duration or workflow.   |
| **Duration field not appearing**     | Enable "Fail with Timeout Error" to adjust the wait duration for file operations.                                         |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Batch Processing**: Wait for a batch file to signal completion before starting data processing.
- **Report Generation**: Pause workflow until a report file appears at a specified location.
- **Cleanup Operations**: Ensure that temporary files are deleted before moving to the next step in a maintenance process.
