# Delete File(s)

The **Delete File(s)** node is used for removing unwanted files from your system based on specified paths. This comes in handy when you need to automatically clear out temporary files, maintain storage hygiene, or remove files generated during earlier automated processes.

The node allows you to specify the path(s) of the files to be deleted. It supports the use of wildcards, simplifying the process of deleting multiple files with similar patterns. For example, you can remove all text files in a directory using `*.txt`.

{/* ![Delete File(s)](./delete-file.png) */}

## Configuration Options

| Field Name            | Description                                                            | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **File(s) to delete** | The path(s) of the file(s) to delete. Supports wildcards like `*.txt`. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

The node performs a file deletion operation and does not produce a data output. However, it executes the task of removing specified files from the file system.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add the **Delete File(s)** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **File(s) to delete** field, enter the paths of the files you wish to delete. You can specify individual file paths or use wildcards if you want to delete multiple files with the same extension or naming pattern.

### Step 3

Once configured, activate your flow to execute the file deletion operation. Ensure that you have specified the correct file paths or patterns to avoid accidental deletion.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Use wildcards (e.g., `*.txt`) to efficiently delete multiple files matching a
  pattern.

<Callout type="warning" title="Caution">
  Be careful when specifying file paths, especially with wildcards, to avoid
  deleting unintended files.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File not found error**                  | Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists in the specified directory. Check for typos or the correct use of wildcards.                   |
| **Unauthorized file deletion error**      | Verify that the flow or user executing the node has the necessary permissions to delete the specified files.                                       |
| **No files deleted when using wildcards** | Double-check that the wildcard pattern matches existing files in the target directory. Ensure there are no typing errors in the extension or path. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Clear Temporary Files**: Automatically delete temporary or obsolete files generated by applications or processes to free up space.
- **Monthly Cleanup Jobs**: Set up regular cleanup operations to manage disk usage by deleting older files, such as logs, that are no longer needed.
- **Data Security**: Ensure sensitive files are deleted securely after processing to maintain data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
