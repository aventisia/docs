# If File Exists

The **If File Exists** node is designed to verify the existence or non-existence of a specified file in your system. This is particularly useful when you need to perform different actions based on whether a file is present or missing in a folder or directory.

For example:

- Check if a configuration file is in place before starting an application.
- Verify if a file has been deleted after a cleanup operation.
- Determine the presence of a backup file before proceeding with data recovery.

## Configuration Options

| Field Name    | Description                                           | Input Type | Required? | Default Value |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **Condition** | Choose to check if the file should exist or not.      | Select     | Yes       | Exists        |
| **File Path** | Specify the exact path of the file you want to check. | Text       | Yes       | _(empty)_     |

## Expected Output Format

The output of this node is a **boolean value**:

- **True**: If the condition specified (exists or doesn't exist) matches the reality.
- **False**: If there's a mismatch between the specified condition and actual file status.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
### Step 1

Add **If File Exists** node into your flow.

### Step 2

In the **File Path** field, enter the complete path to the file you want to check for existence.

### Step 3

From the **Condition** dropdown, select your desired condition:

- **Exists**: Check if the file is present at the specified path.
- **Doesn't Exist**: Verify that the file is absent from the specified path.

### Step 4

After checking, the result (True/False) will be available as **FileExistenceStatus** for further use.

  Ensure that the file path is accurate and accessible to the system to avoid

## Input/Output Examples

| Condition     | File Path               | Output Value | Output Type |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Exists        | C:\Documents\report.txt | True         | Boolean     |
| Doesn't Exist | D:\Backup\oldfile.bak   | False        | Boolean     |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Solution                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **False negatives**                      | Double-check if the specified directory or drive is accessible and path is correct.                                                          |
| **Unexpected False result**              | Ensure the file path does not have typos or permission restrictions causing access issues.                                                   |
| **Condition not performing as expected** | Make sure you've chosen the correct condition in the dropdown, i.e., check `Exists` for existing files and `Doesn't Exist` for missing ones. |

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Automated System Checks**: Confirm critical configuration files are present before launching software.
- **Daily Backups**: Verify the absence of old backup files before creating new ones, ensuring storage efficiency.
- **File Maintenance Scripts**: Use file existence checks to trigger deletion or archival processes conditionally.
