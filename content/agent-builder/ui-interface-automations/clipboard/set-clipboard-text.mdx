# Set Clipboard Text

The **Set Clipboard Text** node allows you to set a specific text value onto your system's clipboard. This is useful for scenarios where you need to automate the process of copying text, such as preparing content to be pasted into emails, documents, or other applications with just a simple action.

For example:

- Preparing a specific piece of text to be pasted into customer emails.
- Automating the copying of user data for reports or forms.
- Setting frequently used responses or data snippets for quick access.
